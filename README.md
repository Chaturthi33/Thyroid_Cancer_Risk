# Thyroid_Cancer_Risk

## Project Overview

##### The goal of this project is to analyze factors affecting thyroid cancer risk using a large dataset of patient records. By studying relationships between age, hormones (TSH, T3, T4), lifestyle factors, and diagnosis, we aim to uncover trends that can help in early detection and risk prediction.
